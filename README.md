# MongoDB Driver Practice
Just a repo I'm using to play around with the mongodb driver and make some changes to a local database.

#### Requirements
Have mongodb installed locally. Easiest way is to use docker and pull down the image with:

`docker pull mongo`

Then run: 

`docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo-prac-db mongo:latest`

This will spin up a instance of MongoDB on port 27017.
